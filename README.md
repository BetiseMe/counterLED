# Basketball scoreboard solo project

## ![SCOREBOARD WITH LED DIGITS](bbcled.gif)

This is version two of two designs. I couldn't decide, so I made it in two versions. This one has a multi-layered CSS background. You could push it further, but I didn't find that it did much (just slowed down the load time).

## About the course

Learn Javascript for free is a beginner's course that guides you through all the necessary steps. I have enjoyed it so far. I have some concerns about writing JavaScript in HTML, but I guess it's much easier for a beginner to do it like that. FreeCodeCamp and The Odin Project take a different approach. I like their beginner lessons better, but this is a good start.

#### Some thoughts

I'm a web designer and a illustrator, so I prefer to put my effort into the design. The JavaScript in this project could easily be improved. I like it more compact and much cleaner code-wise. I don't like doubling up in code like a newbie, but I have already spent too much time on this. When I'm at it, don't copy my solution if you are here to learn how to code. Learn from scratch and you'll thank yourself later. There will be fewer mistakes that way. This project is responsive in design but will break in small browsers like mobile phones. Start with a clean slate in your stylesheet (skip the suggestions) and you won't even need media queries to fix bugs later.

#### Projects I have done so far

- Build a (simple) Passenger Counter app
- The Calculator Challenge (code only, no styling)
- Solo project - Build a Basketball Scoreboard
